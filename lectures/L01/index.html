## Attendance

Attendance at lectures is mandatory and in your best interest. 

Your **Attendance & Comprehension** score is worth 20% of your final grade. Lectures will have graded quizzes throughout, and the top 16 scores will be used to calculate your final grade.

<!--s-->

## Grading

There is a high emphasis on the practical application of the concepts covered in this course. 

<div class = "col-wrapper">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

| Component | Weight |
| --- | --- |

## Homework 

Homeworks are designed to reinforce the concepts covered in lecture. They will be a mix of theoretical and practical problems, and each will include a programmatic and free response portion. If there is time, we will work on homework at the end of every lecture as a group.

- **Due**: Homework due dates are posted in the syllabus.

- **Late Policy**: Late homeworks will lose 1 out of 10 points per day (1% of your final grade).

- **Platform**: A submission script has been provided to submit your homeworks to Canvas, which will be at the end of each notebook.

- **Collaboration**: You are encouraged to work with your peers on homeworks. However, you must submit your own work. Copying and pasting code from other sources will be detected and penalized.

<!--s-->

## Exams

There are two exams in this class. They will cover the theoretical and practical concepts covered in the lectures and homeworks. If you follow along with the lectures and homeworks, you will be well-prepared for the exams.

## Datacamp

<div class = "col-wrapper">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

Datacamp is a platform that provides interactive coding courses, for which a few of you requested access. 

Pending approval from Datacamp, I'll share out the link to the classroom once I have it.

**Participation in Datacamp is not required for this course**. This is just supplementary material to help you learn the concepts at your own pace.

## Academic Integrity [&#x1F517;](https://www.northwestern.edu/provost/policies-procedures/academic-integrity/index.html)

### Homeworks

- Do not exchange code fragments on any assignments.
- Do not copy solutions from any source, including the web or previous MBAI students.
- You cannot upload / sell your assignments to code sharing websites.

<!--s-->

## Accommodations

Any student requesting accommodations related to a disability or other condition is required to register with AccessibleNU and provide professors with an accommodation notification from AccessibleNU, preferably within the first two weeks of class. 

All information will remain confidential.

<!--s-->

## Mental Health

# Homework Onboarding
## H.01 | "Hello, World!"
### Due: 04.10.2025

</div>

<!--s-->

## H.01 | Docker Installation

The first step in this course is to install Docker. Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. We'll go into more detail about what Docker is and how it works in a future lecture.

In the meantime, please install Docker on your machine if you haven't already done so. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

<!--s-->

## H.01 | Download Docker Image and Run Locally

<div class = "col-wrapper">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

### Using the CLI

you can download the Docker image for this course by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker pull joshuadrc/mbai:latest
```

Once the image is downloaded, you can run it using the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 joshuadrc/mbai:latest
```

</div>
<div class="c2" style = "width: 50%">

### Using the GUI

<div style='text-align: center;'>
   <img src='https://storage.googleapis.com/slide_assets/docker.gif' style='border-radius: 10px;'>
</div>


</div>
</div>

<!--s-->

## H.01 | Setting up Docker & Code-Server

The Docker image you just downloaded contains a [code-server](https://github.com/coder/code-server) instance that you can access in your browser. 

This setup allows you to code in a Jupyter notebook environment without having to install anything (besides Docker) on your local machine. To access the code-server instance, open your browser and navigate to <span class="code-span">http://localhost:8080</span>. Alternatively, the link is in your Docker application.

You can bookmark this page, or save it as a local application, for easy access in the future.

> **Note**: If you restart your computer, you will need to restart the Docker container via the application.

<!--s-->

## H.01 | Pulling

Before you start working on any homework, make sure you have the latest version of the repository. The following command in the integrated code-server terminal will pull the latest version of the repository and give you access to the most up-to-date homework:

```bash
git pull
```

<!--s-->

## H.01 | Updating your <span class="code-span">.env</span> file

The <span class="code-span">.env</span> file is a configuration file that contains environment variables for your application. It is used to store sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and other configuration settings.

Using the **same username and password that you used for the slides login**, please fill out the .env file located in the "homeworks" folder of your code-server instance. This information will be used to connect your homeworks to Canvas.

```bash
AG_USERNAME = "your_northwestern_email"
AG_PASSWORD = "your_password"
```

<!--s-->

## H.01 | Setting up Snowflake

Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing service that we will be using for this course. You will need to create an account and set up a database to use Snowflake. 

Please follow the instructions in the [Snowflake Setup Guide](https://signup.snowflake.com/) to create an account. You will also want to do the following once you have access: 

1. Set a budget limit. You get **$400** in free credits for 30 days. Set a budget cap to **$20**, just in case.
2. Collect your account identifer  <span class="code-span">Profile > Account > View Account Details > Account Identifier</span>
3. Collect your username and password. Snowflake requires MFA now, but you will still need to have a password.

<!--s-->

## H.01 | Updating your <span class="code-span">.env</span> file

Please fill out the following fields in the .env file using the information we just collected from Snowflake (this will allow you to connect to Snowflake from your laptop):

```bash
SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT = "your_account_identifier"
SNOWFLAKE_USER = "your_username"
SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD = "your_password"
```
