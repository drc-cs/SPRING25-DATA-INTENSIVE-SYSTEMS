## Databases | What is a database?

A database is a collection of data that is organized in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation. At it's core, a database is simply a structured way to **store** and **manage** data on a computer. 

A database can be as simple as a text file or a spreadsheet, or as complex as a distributed system that spans multiple servers and locations.

## Databases | What makes a **good** database?

- ### Model
- ### Integrity
- ### Access
- ### Security
- ### Scalability

<!--s-->

## Databases | Model

Databases start with a data **model**. A data model is a conceptual representation of the data and its relationships, and it serves as a blueprint for how the data will be stored, organized, and accessed. Different data models are suited for different types of data and use cases.

<div style='text-align: center;'>
   <img src='https://www.gooddata.com/img/blog/_2000xauto/pdm-for-e-commerce.png.webp' style='border-radius: 10px; width: 80%;'>
   <p style='font-size: 0.6em; color: grey; margin: 0;'>Gooddata 2025</p>
</div>

<!--s-->

## Databases | Integrity

Data integrity refers to the accuracy and consistency of data over its entire lifecycle. A good database should enforce data integrity constraints to ensure that the data is **valid** and **reliable**.

<div class = "col-wrapper" style = "font-size: 0.9em;">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%; margin-right: 1em;">

### Constraints
Constraints are rules that define the valid values and relationships for data in a database. They help maintain data integrity by preventing invalid data from being entered into the database.

### Transactions
A transaction is a sequence of operations that are treated as a single unit of work. Transactions ensure that either all operations are completed successfully or none are, maintaining data integrity in the event of errors or failures.

</div>
<div class="c2" style = "width: 50%">

### Normalization
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to minimize redundancy and dependency. It helps maintain data integrity by ensuring that data is stored in a logical and efficient manner.

</div>
</div>

<!--s-->

## Databases | Access

Data access refers to the methods and mechanisms used to retrieve and manipulate data in a database. A good database should provide efficient and flexible data access methods to meet the needs of different applications and users.

Some methods of access include SQL, APIs, GraphQL, and NoSQL queries.

We'll talk more about access in L.03.

<!--s-->

## Databases | Security

Data security refers to the measures taken to protect data from unauthorized access, corruption, or loss. A good database should implement robust security measures to safeguard sensitive data and ensure compliance with regulations.

<div class = "col-wrapper" style = "font-size: 0.9em;">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%; margin-right: 1em;">

### Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of users or applications accessing the database. Support strong authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the data.

### Permissions
Permissions are rules that define what actions users or applications can perform on the data. Provide fine-grained access control to ensure that users can only access the data they are authorized to see.

</div>
<div class="c2" style = "width: 50%">

### Encryption
Encryption is the process of converting data into a secure format that can only be read by authorized users. Use encryption to protect sensitive data both at rest and in transit.

</div>
</div>

<!--s-->

## Databases | Scalability

Data scalability refers to the ability of a database to handle increasing amounts of data and users without sacrificing performance. A good database should be designed to scale horizontally or vertically as needed.

<div class = "col-wrapper">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

### Vertically
Adding more resources to a single server.

### Horizontally
Adding more servers to distribute the load.

## Relational Databases

Relational databases are a type of database management system (DBMS) that store and manage data in a structured format using tables. Each table, or relation, consists of rows and columns, where rows represent individual records and columns represent the attributes of the data.

### Key Vocabulary:

- **Tables:** Organized into rows and columns, with each row being a unique data entry and each column representing a data attribute.
- **Relationships:** Tables are connected through keys, with primary keys uniquely identifying each record and foreign keys linking related records across tables.
- **SQL (Structured Query Language):** The standard language used to query and manipulate data within a relational database.
- **Normalization:** The process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity by dividing large tables into smaller, related tables.

<!--s-->

## Relational Databases

Relational databases are extremely common. Examples of relational databases include **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**.

Relational Databases use SQL (Structured Query Language) to query and manipulate their contained data. SQL is a powerful language that allows for complex queries, joins, and aggregations.

<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">

## SQL Query Cheat Sheet (Part 1)

### `CREATE TABLE`

  ```sql
  /* Create a table called table_name with column1, column2, and column3. */
  CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 INT PRIMARY KEY, /* Primary key is a unique identifier for each row. */
    column2 VARCHAR(100), /* VARCHAR is a variable-length string up to 100 characters. */
    column3 DATE /* DATE is a date type. */
  );
  ```

### `INSERT INTO`

  ```sql
  /* Insert values into column1, column2, and column3 in table_name. */
  INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3) VALUES (value1, value2, value3);
  ```

### `UPDATE`

  ```sql
  /* Update column1 in table_name to 'value' where column2 is equal to 'value'. */
  UPDATE table_name SET column1 = 'value' WHERE column2 = 'value';
  ```

### `DELETE`

  ```sql
  /* Delete from table_name where column1 is equal to 'value'. */
  DELETE FROM table_name WHERE column1 = 'value';
  ```

</div>

<!--s-->

<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">

## SQL Query Cheat Sheet (Part 2)

### `SELECT`
  
  ```sql
  /* Select column1 and column2 from table_name.*/
  SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
  ```

### `WHERE`

  ```sql
  /* Select column1 and column2 from table_name where column1 is equal to 'value' and column2 is equal to 'value'. */
  SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE column1 = 'value' AND column2 = 'value';
  ```

### `ORDER BY`

  ```sql
  /* Select column1 and column2 from table_name and order by column1 in descending order. */
  SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name ORDER BY column1 DESC;
  ```

### `LIMIT`

  ```sql
  /* Select column1 and column2 from table_name and limit the results to 10. */
  SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name LIMIT 10;
  ```

</div>

<!--s-->

<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">

## SQL Query Cheat Sheet (Part 3)

### `JOIN`

  ```sql
  /* Select column1 and column2 from table1 and table2 where column1 is equal to column2. */
  SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.column1 = table2.column2;
  ```

### `GROUP BY`

  ```sql
  /* Select column1 and column2 from table_name and group by column1. */
  SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name GROUP BY column1;
  ```

### `COUNT`

  ```sql
  /* Select the count of column1 from table_name. */
  SELECT COUNT(column1) FROM table_name;

  /* Group by column2 and select the count of column1 from table_name. */
  SELECT column2, COUNT(column1) FROM table_name GROUP BY column2;
  ```

### `SUM`

  ```sql
  /* Select the sum of column1 from table_name. */
  SELECT SUM(column1) FROM table_name;

  /* Group by column2 and select the sum of column1 from table_name. */
  SELECT column2, SUM(column1) FROM table_name GROUP BY column2;
  ```

</div>

<!--s-->

## SQL and Pandas (ðŸ”¥)

```python
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3

# Create a connection to a SQLite database.
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

# Load a DataFrame into the database.
df = pd.DataFrame({'column1': [1, 2, 3], 'column2': ['a', 'b', 'c']})
df.to_sql('table_name', conn, if_exists='replace')

# Query the database.
query = 'SELECT * FROM table_name'
df = pd.read_sql(query, conn)
```

<!--s-->

## Common Table Expression (CTE)

Common Table Expressions are temporary result sets that can be referenced within a <span class="code-span">SELECT</span>, <span class="code-span">INSERT</span>, <span class="code-span">UPDATE</span>, or <span class="code-span">DELETE</span> statement. They are defined using the <span class="code-span">WITH</span> keyword and can be used to simplify complex queries by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts. CTEs can also be recursive, allowing for hierarchical data retrieval.

Below is an example that first defines a CTE (which essentially creates a temporary table) and then uses it in a query.

```sql

WITH bounds AS (
  SELECT MIN(column1) AS min_value, MAX(column1) AS max_value
  FROM table_1_name
)

SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_2_name
WHERE column1 BETWEEN (SELECT min_value FROM bounds) AND (SELECT max_value FROM bounds)

```

<!--s-->

## SQL Aliases

Aliases are temporary names assigned to columns or tables in a SQL query. They are used to make the query more readable and concise, especially when dealing with complex queries or when joining multiple tables. Aliases are defined using the <span class="code-span">AS</span> keyword.

```sql
SELECT column1 AS alias1, column2 AS alias2
FROM table_name AS alias_table
```

<!--s-->


## L.02 | Q.01

Let's say you have a table called <span class="code-span">employees</span> with the following columns: <span class="code-span">id</span>, <span class="code-span">name</span>, <span class="code-span">department</span>, and <span class="code-span">salary</span>. 

<div class = "col-wrapper">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

Write a SQL query to get the sum of the salaries of all employees in the <span class="code-span">Engineering</span> department.

| id | name | department | salary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Alice | Engineering | 50000 |
| 2 | Bob | Sales | 60000 |
| 3 | Charlie | Engineering | 70000 |

## Blob Datastore Application: Image / Video Datasets

<div class = "col-wrapper"  style="font-size: 0.9em;">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%; margin-right: 3%">

### Chunking

Break large datasets into smaller chunks to allow for parallel processing and efficient loading. 

### Compression

Use compression techniques to reduce the size of the datasets stored in the blob datastore.

### Metadata Management
Store metadata about the datasets, such as file size, format, and creation date, to facilitate efficient querying and retrieval.

</div>
<div class="c2" style = "width: 50%">


### Versioning
Implement versioning for datasets to keep track of changes and updates. 

### Compute Resources
Distribute compute resources to process the datasets in parallel. This can be done using cloud services like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.

## Blob Datastore Application: Efficiently Streaming Videos

<div class = "col-wrapper" style="font-size: 0.9em;">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%; margin-right: 5%">

### Chunking
Break the video into smaller chunks to allow for progressive loading and reduce latency. One common format for chunking is **HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)**.

### Adaptive Bitrate Streaming
Use adaptive bitrate streaming to adjust the video quality based on the user's network conditions. This ensures a smooth playback experience without buffering.

</div>
<div class="c2" style = "width: 50%">

### Content Delivery Network (CDN)
Use a CDN to cache and deliver the video content closer to the user. This reduces latency and improves the streaming experience.

### Caching
Implement caching strategies to store frequently accessed video chunks in memory or on disk.

# Hierarchical Databases

</div>

<!--s-->

## Hierarchical Databases

Hierarchical databases store data in a tree-like structure, where each record has a parent-child relationship with other records. They are often used in applications that require a clear hierarchy, such as file systems and XML data. Hierarchical databases are less common today but were widely used in early database systems. They differ from graph databases in that they have a strict hierarchy, while graph databases allow for more complex relationships.
